cat("What's up aliens. Hope yall are peaceful. With how its going on earth you\n
    probably won't be rip. But anyways if you got some crazy technologies like\n
    fusion power, vaccines, or something it would be great if you could to send it all over.\n
    Could be quite useful right about now as our planet ain't doing so well. \n
    But don't send us any weapons or anything because we got enough of those :( \n
    Any help is appreciated!\n\n
    Signed your poor celestial neighbor,\n
